Bobbin is a pure Java BitTorrent library. It is currently being developed as a testbed for protocol extension research.

At present, a selection of core standards have been implemented, but the library has not seen widespread real life deployment. Use in a production situation is not yet recommended. Interfaces and behaviour may change at any time.

Bobbin contains the reference implementation of the [Elastic extension](ElasticExtension.md), an experimental extension that allows torrents to be securely extended after creation.
